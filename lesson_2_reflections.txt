These are the reflections from lesson2

Initializing a Repository
Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you 
need to do it?
A: Git sets up an empty repository (makes a new directory .git), and
initializes it. The repository has NO commits yet.

Staging Area
Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory
 and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: The staging area is a subset of the working directory. It allows you 
to bundle up the files you would like in this commit(?) before
commiting.
